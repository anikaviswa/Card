        <p class="border">Anika is a first-year Computer Science major who is passionate about tutoring students. In high school, she volunteered as a tutor for a nonprofit, volunteered at the local elementary school's After School Program to help the children with their homework, and founded the Computer Science Honor Society at her high school in which members had the opportunity to tutor the students at the local elementary school on coding. In her free time, she likes to read, run, and spend time with her friends and family.</p>
